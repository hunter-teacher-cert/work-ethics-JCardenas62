# Final Project Proposal #
## Names:
Jovani Cardenas; Chris O' Brien

## Proposal
Explore the right to repair and how it affects users of software and hardware. We will explain the concept, cover recent legislative efforts on the Federal and state level, and demonstrate a simple program to help a user determine how to repair a product on their own.

## Sample Code
There is a large argument that owners do not possess the technical skills
to fix, or repair their devices. Code will demo how simple programs can aid
owners in repairing their own devices by interacting with a simple input-output
system.
